# PlugDemo

** This is a simple sample plug application.  **

It was based upon the instructions in  https://elixirschool.com/en/lessons/specifics/plug/


This is a test application to experiment with the Plug framework

To run use:

mix run --no-halt

The only gotcha I found was that http://localhost:8080 did not work.

Then visit http://127.0.0.1:8080
